<h1>Glade Future Plans</h1>				

<h2>Glade 2</h2>
<p>
There won't be much new development on Glade 2 any more.
We'll try to add support for new GTK+ features until Glade 3 is ready
but there probably won't be many other changes.
</p>

<h2>Glade 3</h2>
<p>
Glade 3 is a complete rewrite of Glade currently under development.
</p>

<p>For the end user the most noticeable differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undo/Redo support in all the operations.</li>
<li>Open multiple projects at same time.</li>
<li>Removal of code generation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With regard to the last item, note that code generation has been deprecated
for a long time: the preferred solution is using 
<a href="http://www.daa.com.au/%7Ejames/software/libglade">libglade</a>.
If you want to use code generation at any cost, the way to go is using an
external tool to process the .glade file and output code in your language of
choice. The format of the .glade file is the same as Glade-2.

</p><p>
Most of the differences with Glade-2 are in the internals, in fact
Glade-3 is a complete rewrite of the Glade codebase. This was chosen to take 
advantage of the new features of GTK+ 2 and of the GObject sytem (Glade-3
was started when Glade-2 hadn't been ported yet to GTK+ 2).
As a consequence, the Glade-3 codebase is smaller and allows new interesting
things, including:

</p>
<ul>
<li> Catalogs of widgets that are "pluggable", this means that external libraries can
provide their set of widgets at runtime and Glade will detect them. As a matter of fact
Glade-3 comes with standard GTK+ widgets only; Gnomeui and Gnome-db widgets will be
provided separately.
</li><li>The various Glade Tools (palette, editor, etc) are implemented as widgets,
this should allow easier integration in IDEs like Anjuta or Scaffold. This will
also make it alot easier change the Glade UI.
</li></ul>


<h2>Glade-3 status and planning</h2>
<p>
Glade-3 is only a few features and bugfixes away from covering the full feature
set of Glade-2, the plan is to get these last fixes in and make a stable "3.0" 
release so that we can start integrating all the interesting non-widget objects 
relevent to the UI. Since this is going to require another vehicle than current 
versions of libglade the codebase may change dramaticly; so that is the first
thing I want to address.
</p>
<h2>Glade-3 wants you</h2>
<p>
Given that the Glade user base is mostly made of developers it would be great
if you could help with it: work on Glade-3 may be a great learning experience 
since the difficulty of things you can work on range from basic GTK+ GUI 
programming to the deep secrets of the GObject system.
</p><p>
If you don't have the time to help with programming; testing and reporting bugs would
still be greatly appreciated.
</p><p>
For a list of things that need doing, check out the 
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query=product%3Aglade3">bugs in bugzilla</a>.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
You can always get the latest
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glade-3/">development snapshot</a>
and build it with the usual:
</p><p>
<tt>
./configure<br/>
make<br/>
make install<br/>
</tt>
</p><p>
You can also get the bleeding edge code from GNOME cvs with the following commands:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome login</tt> [just press enter when asked for a password]<br/>
<tt>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co glade3</tt><br/>
</p><p>
Then to build enter the glade3 directory and run the usual:
</p><p>
<tt>
./autogen<br/>
make<br/>
make install<br/>
</tt>
</p><p>
Glade-3 now also has
<a href="http://gnome.org/~tvb/glade_api/">documentation</a> to help you add your
own widget implementations to the builder at runtime, integrate Glade-3 into your
own IDE tool, or ofcourse; improve Glade-3 itself ;-)
</p>

<a href="http://glade.gnome.org/lists.html">glade-devel</a> list.
